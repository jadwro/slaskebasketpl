[> 30-Jul-2002 -- v1.4
+ Some more improvements on security measures.  Nothing that changed from
  version 1.3 is critical-- just some extra safeguards.

[> 30-Jul-2002 -- v1.3
  ***************************************************
- ** IMPORTANT SECURITY FIX -- UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY **
  ** Thanks Mats Linander, for reporting this one  **
  ***************************************************
- Another attempt to fix admin login problem for the few people still
  experiencing it (thanks Ogre2112)
- Fixed a problem in setup procedure when using php3 file extension
+ Automatically detect available list of language packs instead of
  hard-coding the list in each release
+ Did the same thing for list of results bar images
+ Added dutch language file (thanks Jonathan Tamboer)
* Some directory structure has changed!

[> 24-JUL-2002 -- v1.2
- Fixed possible warning when PHP is operating in safe-mode
- Reverted to PHP setcookie() instead of sending manual Set-Cookie header
+ Add creation timestamp info to poll list in administration page
+ Add language support to the administration web interface.  Please send
  me ACCURATE translations of the custom.php file in your language! 
  See README for details.  Thanks Thomas Janotta for the German translation
  and Alberto Giacobo for the Italian translation.
* Don't bold the option you vote for.  It confuses too many people
  Plus it shouldn't be difficult for people to remember anyway.  =)
* Set IP logging to off by default on new installs, since it can prevent
  people that are being NAT'd behind a firewall from voting if someone
  else behind the same firewall has already voted.  Doesn't affect upgrades.
* Switched to CSS for border stuff (thanks webmaster@cyaccess.eclipse.co.uk)
  This cleans up the nested tables by removing a level of it
* Poll lists now list from newest to oldest, ordered by creation timestamp

[> 03-JUN-2002 -- v1.1
- Fixed a problem where some versions of MySQL could not create the
  sympoll_iplog table

[> 01-JUN-2002 -- v1.0
- Important security fix!
- Fixed cookie problem with PHP 4.2.0
- Fixed a problem where editing a poll without adding new options could
  possibly corrupt the poll data
- Fixed possible incorrect link generation when an index file doesn't
  have its name specified as part of the URL
- Improved XHTML compliance in the admin section
+ Another big change to the admin layout; I actually like it this time =)
+ Much improved ip logging maintainence (now on a poll-by-poll basis)
+ Polls now have three possible status choices:  hidden, open, closed
+ Polls can now allow one option per vote, or numerous options per vote
+ Extra statistics now available when IP logging is enabled
* Allow Sympoll to accept blank MySQL username and/or password
* Allow Sympoll to accept blank colors in display configuration
* Improved "voter privacy" when IP logging is enabled

[> 04-MAR-2002 -- v0.4.5  (note: this version is 1.0rc3)
- Fixed a problem with HTTP vs. HTTPS
- Fixed "Cannot redeclare ...." errors
- Fixed more problems when turning off referral link.  (thanks PoorOldLuu)
- Fixed a few trivial PHP warnings
* Changed license to a derivitive of The Apache Software License
* Added more info in the README about using an SSI to include a poll
* Layout of polllist.php is more consistent between different polls
* Pulled out some of the object-oriented PHP stuff

[> 08-JAN-2002 -- v0.4.4  (note: this version is 1.0rc2)
- Fixed a problem with URLs being generated incorrectly on free.fr
  (and any other system that uses proxad)
- Added support for ports other than 80.  (thanks chris)
* Completely "HTML 4.01 Transitional" compliant.  This does not include
  the admin section.  (thanks richard)
* More "XHTML 1.0 Transitional" compatibilty.  Only one tag is not
  compliant, but changing it breaks HTML/4.01 validation so it won't be
  fixed any time soon.  It's the meta tag in include/header.php.
  (not including admin section)

[> 05-JAN-2002 -- v0.4.3  (note: this version is 1.0rc1)

  changing other configuration options.  (thanks kurt)
- Tried to fix some other option problems that only messed up in PHP3.  
- Fixed a problem with the wrong links being generated on certain hosts
  that use a proxy server for  PHP scripts.  (thanks stephane bernaud)
- Fixed some problems with having a random poll and non-random polls
  on the same page.  Please see the note added to README file in the 
  section named  EXTRA 1.  (thanks gmt)
* Began the process of making Sympoll XHTML/1.0 compatible.  Still more
  to do on this in a later release
* Administration page got a cosmetic makeover
* Minor changes to the README file
* Happy New Year!

[> 29-NOV-2001 -- v0.4.2

  to duplicate)
- Tried to fix an include problem in the admin section that some people
  seem to experience

  improvement, file reorganization, etc

- Fixed another rare "failed opening xx for inclusion" problem
- Added a couple more lines to the language.php file
- Made path corrections (for detecting cgi-wrapper) smarter

  used with, or instead of, tracking via cookies.
* Several other minor feature and cosmetic tweaks
